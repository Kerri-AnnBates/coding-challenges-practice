The factorial of the integer `n`, written `n!`, is defined as:

```
n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
```

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if `n = 30`, we calculate `30 * 29 * 28 * ... * 2 * 1` and get `265252859812191058636308480000000`

Note: Factorials of `n > 20` can't be stored even in a `64 - bit` long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
